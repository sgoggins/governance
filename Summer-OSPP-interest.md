# Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan Interested Candidates

Hi potential candidates,

A few details regarding the application process specific to the CHAOSS project:

1) You must choose one of the ideas present in [Summer-OSPP-ideas.md](./Summer-OSPP-ideas.md) page and contact the mentors & discuss your plans about the project. You are expected to work on the Project Application Proposal. If you have any microtasks for the project, you are expected to work on them too.

2) Once you have completed working on the Proposal, create a pull request on this file below to add yourself, your information, and a link to your proposal and microtasks repo (if any). 

**NOTE:** This repository requires [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) sign-off; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/chaoss/governance/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-or-document-change-contributions-github-interface) for details on how to sign your commits.

3) You are welcome to include in your repositories other information that could be of interest, such as open issues or pull requests submitted to the project to which you intend to contribute during the program, contributions to other projects, skills, and other related information.

4) Using and submitting other people's work as your own is not allowed. If you use other people's work, be sure to acknowledge their work in your submission.

You must complete these things by June 13, 2021 ([Calendar](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/help/en/student/#calendar)). Make sure you zip the required materials in to one archive and submit in [Open Source Promotion Plan Management System](https://portal.summer-ospp.ac.cn/summer/) before the deadline. Here is the [guidelines and Project Application Template](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/help/en/assets/Project-Application-Template.pdf). Please chek the [Student Help Guide](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/help/en/student/) for more information.


Regards,
Summer OSPP Mentors
